    abstract = {Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) is one of the most
                important high level operations for basic linear algebra.
                Nowadays, the GPU has evolved into a highly parallel coprocessor
                which is suited to compute-intensive, highly parallel
                computation. Achieving high performance of SpMV on GPUs is
                relatively challenging, especially when the matrix has no
                specific structure. For these general sparse matrices, a new data
                structure based on the bisection ELLPACK format, BiELL, is
                designed to realize the load balance better, and thus improve the
                performance of the SpMV. Besides, based on the same idea of JAD
                format, the BiJAD format can be obtained. Experimental results on
                various matrices show that the BiELL and BiJAD formats perform
                better than other similar formats, especially when the number of
                non-zero elements per row varies a lot.},
