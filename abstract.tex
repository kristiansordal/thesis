\textsc{Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication} is an important kernel used in scientific computing. It is a problem that lends itself well to parlallization. The problem is bounded by, and scales with the memory bandwidth of the system. Therefore in order to efficiently perform \textit{SpMV} on large distributed memory systems, it is important to reduce the communication between nodes, in order to extract as much as possible out of the memory bandwidth of the system.

This thesis aims to investigate the results of \textit{SpMV} when ran using different communication strategies.
